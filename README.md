# Resume Clone

This is my version of the "Resume Clone" project from the [Computer Science and Web Development course](https://github.com/thancock20/computer-science-and-web-development).

The purpose of this project is to clone the resume template found [here](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2) using just HTML and CSS.
